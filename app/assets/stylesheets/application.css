Using Bootstrap 3 with Rails 4

If you are looking to use Bootstrap 3 with Rails, then this article is for you. It provides a guide to adding Bootstrap 3, aka Twitter Bootstrap 3, to a new Rails 4 project. I found this article from Eric Minkel, however I’ve deviated slightly from his implementation and I decided to document it.

Let’s start by creating a new project:

rails new bootstrap

Next, we need Bootstrap 3 and you can download the latest version here. At the time this article was written, the latest Bootstrap release was v3.0.2.

I’m only interested in using the minimized Bootstrap files. We need to copy a number of files into our project from the Bootstrap download:

    Copy bootstrap.min.css to the /vendor/assets/stylesheets directory
    Copy bootstrap.min.js to the /vendor/assets/javascripts directory
    Copy the fonts directory and its contents to /vendor/assets/

Now that the files have been added to your project. We need to tell the application to use them.

Edit app/assets/stylesheets/application.css and add *= require bootstrap.min along with some @font-face overrides which change the path to the glyphicons. We’ll do that here to avoid changing the bootstrap files.


*= require_self
*= require bootstrap_and_overrides
*= require sidenav
*= require jquery.countdown
*= require tinyscroll
*= require_tree .
*/

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Glyphicons Halflings';
  src: url('../assets/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot');
  src: url('../assets/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'), 
       url('../assets/glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff') format('woff'), 
       url('../assets/glyphicons-halflings-regular.ttf') format('truetype'), 
       url('../assets/glyphicons-halflings-regular.svg#glyphicons_halflingsregular') format('svg');
}
